* Pinout List
* Dac0 - Waveform output
* Dac1 - Amplitude output
* D2 - Synch Pin Output (For debugging purposes)
* D22 - Ampltidue Encoder Input
* D23 - Amplitude Encoder Input
* D24 - Period Encoder Input
* D25 - Period Encoder Input
* D26 - Waveform Select Encoder
* D27 - Waveform Select Encoder
* D28 - Single pulse flag (LOW enables single pulse mode)
* D29 - Single pulse trigger. (LOW will cause the arduino to send 1 waveform pulse)
* D30 - Slow pulse flag (LOW enables a pulse rate of 3 pulses/second)
